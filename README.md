#Marco Sacristão
## About me
My name is Marco Sacristão, I'm a 23 year old computer engineering student
 from Portugal.
 I have a strong passion for great design, including video game design.
 
 My dad was a great inspiration for me, he started self-teaching programming at an early age when the internet was still a thing that not many people had access to where we lived, he did make money from it and he was the person responsible for my passion for video games, so I then understood that I could become more like him and use programming languages to create my own games.
 
 I love learning about and mastering new technologies it is truly a part of who I am, and once I have a better grasp of what I'm dealing with I love hacking my way through documentation and code to try and build some useful projects for myself, or my future clients.
